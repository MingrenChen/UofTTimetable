# UofTTimetable


This is a project for me to choose which section I should go in U of T.
It contains a simple spider crawl from
[UofT's official timetable](https://timetable.iit.artsci.utoronto.ca/)
in main_spider.

Create a database by run UofT.sql and load the data by load_data.py.

After thatï¼Œ change the code in main.py to choose which course you want to
select.
